## Summary

LUMA or Lähitason Uuden sukupolven Myymälä Avustaja is a virtual online store assitant that helps customers find the right product and provide directions to its exact shelf/aisle location in a giant retail/wholesale store. 

## Background

LUMA solves the most common challenge a retail store faces day in and day out. Peek- a- boo customers - Customers who step in for a quick purchase, roam around inside the giant store endlessly, ultimaltey they don't find what they are looking for and simply leave without making a purchase. 


## How is it used?

LUMA is simple an AI based intelligent virtual assistant that is present in the form a kiosk/digital interface with screens at every corner of the store. A customer just has to walk to it, search for the products he/she is looking for and hit search.  The search result returned will include product availability, price, shelf location in store, if not available what are the alternates/similar products that the customer can go for and lastly if the store has other branches show availability in other store locations as well.

What makes LUMA unique is that is not just another search engine but a legit chatgpt type assistant. Meaning users can describe the products in great detail if they wish or if they don't know which product exactly they want. 

For example, I want to replace the tubelight of my bathroom. Now I know I want a tubelight, but Im unaware of the type of tubelight I want, the type of pin, the length, the wattage, size etc. And to make things more complicated, I have to get it replaced on a Monday morning and there is no actual human help available at the store. There is only person, the cashier and he is busy tending to other customers. What do I do? An AI based virtual in store assitant like LUMA is a perfect solution for such and many similar use cases.
